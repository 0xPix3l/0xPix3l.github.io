I demonstrate how I pwned Cicada on HackTheBox. 

This box mostly emphasizes two important skills:
- Enumrating Active Directory's RIDs for potential list of valid usernames
- Abusing the backup operators group

first nmap scan:

```bash
~/htb/cicada$ nmap -sC -sV -Pn -vv -p- -oN scan.nmap 10.10.11.35

Increasing send delay for 10.10.11.35 from 0 to 5 due to 11 out of 25 dropped probes since last increase.

So it is pure AD enum, after adding `cicada.htb` to hosts file I get to work

# SMB Enumeration
I started with enumerating the SMB shares with null session:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/smb1.png)

HR share was public so I connected to it and found `Notice from HR.txt`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/smb2.png)

After downloading and reading it I had a Password:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/backup_script.png)


I need to obtain a user list in order to validate this password, so I attempted kerbrute, but it was slow and didn't yield many results.
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/kerbrute.png)


So we can enumerate users by RIDs if we had access to. We can use `impacket-lookupsid`, `Metasploit` or there is a cool switch I discovered earlier in [NetExec](https://www.netexec.wiki/smb-protocol/enumeration/enumerate-users-by-bruteforcing-rid):
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/rid_enum.png)

with some bash we can extract valid users into a file to check with the obtained pass
```bash
cat users.txt | cut -d ':' -f 2 | cut -d '\' -f 2 | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | uniq >> potential_users.txt
```

And we got a hit on `mark.wrightson`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/user-pass_hit.png)

Before moving forward, let's review what RIDs are.

## RID Bruteforcing
In Windows, every object, including users and groups, is identified by a Security Identifier (SID). A SID is composed of:
- A domain identifier that stays the same for all users within the domain.
- A RID that uniquely identifies a user or group within the domain.

Example Breakdown:\
SID: `S-1-5-21-3623811015-3361044348-30300820-500`
- Domain SID: `S-1-5-21-3623811015-3361044348-30300820`
- RID: 500 (the built-in Administrator account)

So SID = Domain Identifier + RID.

Regular user accounts generally start at 1000. So what any of the above tools do is increment the RID by one to get the associated user.

### Why This Works?

Windows doesn’t necessarily block the querying of SIDs, and if the system doesn’t have proper restrictions, it will return details about valid users based on the provided RIDs.

### Mitigation
To mitigate RID enumeration attacks:
- Accounts: Guest account status: `Disabled`
- Network access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users: `Disabled`
- Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares: `Enabled`
- Use group policies to restrict SID enumeration by untrusted users.

As shown it is disabled by default.

Back to pwning..

## LDAP Enumeration
Now I have a valid user and password. After alot of enumerating I queried a ldap query to see users description cause it usually contains passwords.\
So I got another valid user and pass:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/ldap-search.png)


I discovered that this user did have access to brand-new SMB share. It is DEV, which I wasn't previously able to access it.
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/read_dev.png)

It included a script file, which I downloaded and looked at to discover  another user with her password.

WINRMing to get the first flag

## PrivEsc
First thing I did was checking her groups:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/emily_privs.png)


I leveraged her membership in the Backup Operators group to extract the SAM and system registry files.
```powershell
reg save hklm\sam c:\Temp\sam
reg save hklm\system c:\Temp\system
```
Used `Impacket-secretsdump` to dump admin hash
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Cicada/admin_hash.png)


WINRMing using the admin hash to get the root flag

Happy pwning!
