So only two ports open. The webapp endpoint is `/login.php` so after trying different combinations and enumerating both subdomains and directories I got nothing, but I noticed something.
The page outputs different according to the username provided
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/1.png)
But here it tells us that only the password is wrong so then username `admin` is valid

## Foothold

I tried to bruteforce the password with username `admin` but it wasn't successful. So I created a python script that enumerate over the `username` field based on the page error output
```python
import requests
wordlist = "/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt"


with open(wordlist, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        username = line.strip()
        if not username:
            continue

        data = {"username": username,
                "password": "testpassword"}
        response = requests.post(url="http://lookup.thm/login.php", data=data)

        if "Wrong password" in response.text:
            print(f"\r[*] Found a username! \"{username}\"")


print()
```

and I got a new valid user
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/script2.png)

next I used hydra to brute the passowrd with the new user
```console
hydra -l jose -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt lookup.thm http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Wrong password" -V
```
And we got a password
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/hydra.png)
I got redirected to `files.lookup.thm`. added it to `/etc/hosts` and I got to this page
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/elfinder1.png)
Poking around I knew the version of this file manager
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/elfinder2.png)

I went to the project repo on github and opened secuirty tab to see the vulnerabilities and it got a RCE for the versions <= 2.1.58
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/vuln.png)
So I searched for an exploit And [Metaslploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/http/elfinder_archive_cmd_injection.rb#L35C21-L35C25) has an exploit for the same CVE
and we got a shell as `www-data`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/shell1.png)

First thing I noticed that there is a user called `think`, and I like to try different things before uploading automated tools like `linpeas`. So I searched for SUID binaries
```console
run find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
```
and there was an interesting one called `pwn`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/pwn_running.png)
so it is trying to execute `id` and get the username out of it, if we could trick it to think that we are the user `think` we can see the content of `/home/think/.passwords`.

If we are lucky enough that the binary is executing the command `id` without using the full path, we can add a modified script has the same name and append it's path to the path variable. Lets try that
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/prep.png)
Aaaand...
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/pwn_works.png)
I got what appears to be a password list. So I tried to crack the ssh creds of the user `think`
```console
hydra -l "think" -P pass.txt ssh://10.10.96.169 -V
```
And we got the user flag.

## PrivEsc
It was pretty straight forward I tried `sudo -l` to see what I can run as root
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Lookup/sudo_l.png)
I went to [GTFO bins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/look/#sudo) and I found this:
> If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.
```console
LFILE=file_to_read
sudo look '' "$LFILE"
```



usually the root flag is located in `/root`. So I did the same and got the root flag
