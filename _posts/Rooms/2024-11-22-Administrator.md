This machine necessitates a basic understanding of active directory and how to take use of both `DCSync` and `GenericWrite` misconfigurations.\
The author provides creds for initial access
> As is common in real life Windows pentests, you will start the Administrator box with credentials for the following account: Olivia / ichliebedich

port `88` is open so  itâ€™s highly likely a Domain Controller, from ldap output we can see the domain is `administrator.htb`.

After adding it to `/etc/hosts` I started to mess around in `SMB` shares but it was fruitless, I noticed port `21` is running so I tried to connect to it using the provided creds but I couldn't with this user

I run bloodhound to get more info
```bash
bloodhound-python -u Olivia -p  -c All -d ichliebedich -dc administrator.htb -ns 10.10.11.42
```

## User flag

After messing around in `bloodhound` I noticed this
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Administrator/olivia_micheal.png)
`GenericAll` gives the right to `Olivia` to change `Micheal` Password without knowing it, so I used `net.exe` (connected with `evil-winrm` using `olivia` creds) to change `Micheal` password
```bash
net user micheal michealpassword123!
```

After owning `micheal` I searched for his rights and I found the following
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Administrator/michael_benjamin.png)
I tried using `net` cmdlet again but it failed, so I used `bloodyAD`
```bash
bloodyAD.py --host "10.10.11.42" -d "administrator.htb" -u "michael" -p "michealpassword123!" set password "benjamin" "benjaminpassword123!"
```
Now we own 3 users.

I got stuck here for some time but I remembered the open port on `21`, so tried to connect to it with the newly-owned users and got a hit on the `benjamin` user

There was a file called `Backup.psafe3` so I donwloaded it, I searched for applications that support this type of files and I found [password safe](https://pwsafe.org/).
> the file can also be dowloaded using NetExec:
```bash
nxc ftp administrator.htb -u 'benjamin' -p ****** --get Backup.psafe3
```



The app asked for the file and master password for the file, `hashcat` has module for it
```bash
hashcat Backup.psafe3 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m 5200 --force
```
And it cracked the safe!

`emily` passowrd was valid

## Root flag
After poking around I saw something interesting
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Administrator/methodology.png)

`emily` has `GenericWrite` over `ethan`, and `ethan` has `DCSync` over the domain. So our methodology here is going to be getting the hash for `ethan` and crack it to be able to get the hash of `administrator`.

### GenericWrite
It can be exploited using [targetedKerberoast](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast)
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Administrator/ethan_hash.png)
running `hashcat` on the hash and it was crackable

### DCSync
with `ethan` password now we can use `secretsdump` from Impacket to get `administrator` hash

And the machine is pwned
