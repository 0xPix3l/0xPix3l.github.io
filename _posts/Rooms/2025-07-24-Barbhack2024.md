This lab was part of 2024's BarbHack hacking conference's CTF and was created by [mpgn](https://x.com/mpgn_x64) who is known for his contributaions to [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec).

from oficial repo:

> Originally featured in the Barbhack 2024 CTF, this lab is now available for free to everyone! In this lab, you’ll explore how to use the powerful tool NetExec to efficiently compromise an Active Directory domain during an internal pentest.

The deployment of it is quite simple, similar to the GOAD lab setup, which I wrote about [here](https://0xpix3l.github.io/Active-Directory/installing-goad/), and can be done like any Ansible playbook deployment. Ansible isn't the only option—other tools are listed too, depending on what you're comfortable with. With a few tweaks to the IP addresses to avoid conflicts with my GOAD setup, I was ready to go.

All the details on how to deploy it is [here](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec-Lab), This lab can also be deployed using [Ludus](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/environment-guides/barbhack-ctf-2024/).

There are 13 flags to capture in total—covering various Active Directory misconfigurations and enumeration techniques.

My goal in solving this lab isn’t just to capture the flags, but to learn new techniques and understand each attack—down to the wire—through low-level network analysis.


**Time to compromise Gotham City!** 🦇

## Setup

It consist of three machines configured with those IPs:

- `DC01.GOTHAM.CITY`    ⇒ 192.168.56.20
- `SRV01.GOTHAM.CITY`   ⇒ 192.168.56.21     
- `SRV02.GOTHAM.CITY`   ⇒ 192.168.56.22

## Enumeration
Nmap didn't yield any unusual service, all default DC stuff.

I think in most machine-based CTFs, one of the first things everyone typically do is enumerate SMB. I run nxc against all of the 3 machines with `guest` session because `null` session was disabled. And I got this:

```shell
└─$ nxc smb ip.txt -u 'guest' -p '' --shares

```
Something worth noticing—aside from the `READ, WRITE` permissions on a share in `SRV01`—is that both `SRV01` and `SRV02` have `SMB signing: False`, which *might* be useful later for relaying.

We can then use nxc module `spider_plus` to see what is actually inside `CleanSlate` share:
```json
{
    "CleanSlate": {
        "cleanslate.exe": {
            "atime_epoch": "2025-07-23 06:37:48",
            "ctime_epoch": "2025-07-23 06:37:48",
            "mtime_epoch": "2025-07-23 06:37:55",
            "size": "10.02 MB"
        }
    }
}                                                                                                                                                                                        
```

## 1st flag

After downloading it and running it on a Windows VM, the program prompts for a key. If the key is incorrect, it simply exits. So we need to reverse it, but how??

The first thing I did was try to reverse it using Ghidra, but it was a bit complex for me (or maybe I’m just still not that good yet at reversing :D ), so I got curious about what language it was written in.
There is a great tool called [Detect It Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) determined to identify and retrieve the signatures of executables.

![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Gotham_city/python.png)

If we clicked on the capital `S` there we can see the signatures:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Gotham_city/sig.png)

Another thing that is worth noticing according to [this blog](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/unpacking-python-executables-windows-linux) which explain the whole process of decompilation, we can determine the Python version as we can see PyInstaller first unpacks all files in the temporary folder and calls for `dll` for it's version:

![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Gotham_city/py_version.png)
So that executable was packed using PyInstaller with Python 3.11.

It's my first time recovering source code from a compiled PyInstaller executable, After some research, I learned there are two main steps to get the source code:

1. Unpack all files from the EXE. This will extract the bundled files, including the compiled Python bytecode (.pyc) files. Using a tool like [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor).
2. Decompile the relevant .pyc files to recover readable Python source code. Using a tool like [uncompyle6](https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6.git).

Executing `pyinstxtractor`:
```bash
└─$ python3 pyinstxtractor.py ../../cleanslate.exe
[+] Processing ../../cleanslate.exe
[+] Pyinstaller version: 2.1+
[+] Python version: 3.11
[+] Length of package: 10172177 bytes
[+] Found 26 files in CArchive
[+] Beginning extraction...please standby
[+] Possible entry point: pyiboot01_bootstrap.pyc
[+] Possible entry point: pyi_rth_inspect.pyc
[+] Possible entry point: pyi_rth_pkgutil.pyc
[+] Possible entry point: cleanslate.pyc
[!] Warning: This script is running in a different Python version than the one used to build the executable.
[!] Please run this script in Python 3.11 to prevent extraction errors during unmarshalling
[!] Skipping pyz extraction
[+] Successfully extracted pyinstaller archive: ../../cleanslate.exe

You can now use a python decompiler on the pyc files within the extracted directory
```
There are often some false positives, our main focus on `cleanslate.pyc`

Now time for step 2:\
I searched for another tool and I found on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1ddiq3h/whats_the_best_way_to_decompile_pyc_files_python/) an [online tool](https://pylingual.io) to do the hard work for us:

```python
# Decompiled with PyLingual (https://pylingual.io)
# Internal filename: cleanslate.py
# Bytecode version: 3.11a7e (3495)

from rich.progress import Progress
import time
import os
import base64

def shift_char(c, shift):
    """Shift character by shift amount."""
    if c.isalpha():
        shift_amount = shift + 26
        base = 'A' if c.isupper() else 'a'
        return (chr * ord(c) * ord(base), shift_amount + 26)(ord(base))
        return True
    if c.isdigit():
        shift_amount = shift + 10
        return (chr | ord(c) | ord('0'), shift_amount | 10)(ord('0') + __main__)
    return c
KEY_FILE = 'C:\\SHARE\\key.txt'
KEY = 'fTk1NmRkMDQ2MDBpNjdnZDU0Z2dlMjdoNDNlZjJlNzFme2V1ZQ=='

def is_valid_key(input_key):
    if os.path.exists(KEY_FILE):
        with open(KEY_FILE, 'r') as file:
            stored_key = file.read().strip()
        if input_key == stored_key:
            return True
        if len(input_key) == 24 and 'GOTHAMCITY' in input_key:
            return True
    return False

def cleaning(encoded_flag):
    decoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(encoded_flag)
    decoded_flag = decoded_bytes.decode()
    shift = 3
    reversed_shifted_flag = ''.join((shift_char(c, -shift) for c in decoded_flag))
    original_flag = reversed_shifted_flag[::-1]
    return original_flag

def main():
    key = input('Enter your key: ')
    if is_valid_key(key):
        print('Key is valid! Cleaning data...')
        with Progress() as progress:
            task = progress.add_task('[green]Processing...', total=100)
            for i in range(100):
                time.sleep(0.05)
                progress.update(task, advance=1)
        print('Process completed! Flag:', cleaning(KEY))
    else:
        print('Invalid key. Please try again.')
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The logic of the code is quite easy, just checking if `input_key` matches the key that is in `C:\SHARE\key.txt`, or if the `input_key` is exactly 24 characters long and includes the string `GOTHAMCITY`. And we can see it actually tries to open it in `procmon`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Gotham_city/key.png)

I was too lazy to create a folder on the VM and put the `key.txt` there so I tried to print a 24 char including the `GOTHAMCITY` string.
```bash
└─$ python3 -c "print('a' * 14 + 'GOTHAMCITY')"
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaGOTHAMCITY
```
but it somehow didn't work, remember this code is decompiled so the flow of the code maybe different from the actual one.


after creating the desired `key.txt` we got back the 1st flag!
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Gotham_city/1st.png)

> *Just to  to satisfy my curiosity, I wanted to know if the 24-char string that includes `GOTHAMCITY` (not the string in the `key.txt`) would work now with the file in the correct path??..*
*and it actually worked?, but it still reads the 5-char string `pix3l` from the `key.txt`.*
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Gotham_city/why.png)
*My assumption is that the original code runs inside a `try-except` block.*

## 2nd flag

I tried to gain an initial foothold by obtaining user credentials on the domain. I attempted to enumerate LDAP for any plain-text passwords in user descriptions, but guest access was disabled, Even getting valid usernames needs a potential user list, but since the domain is `GOTHAMCITY`, I figured the users might be named after Batman characters. Worth a shot, right?

And of course, there's a live website that serves an [API](https://batmanapi.com/) has all character names.

Getting characters names:
```bash
└─$ for i in $(seq 1 83); do curl -s "https://api.batmanapi.com/v1/characters/$i" | tee -a characters.json ;done
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Bruce Wayne",
      "alias": "Batman",
      "alive": true,
      "role": "Hero",
      "description": "The Dark Knight and protector of Gotham City.",
      "creator": "Tom King, Scott Snyder",
      "first_appearance": "Batman: Rebirth #1",
      "gender": "Male",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/images/bruce_wayne.jpg",
      "abilities": [
        "Martial Arts",
        "Detective Skills",
        "Stealth"
      ]
    }
  },
--- SNIP ---
```
it outputs a json file contains all the 83 character of the universe of batman, now I need to only extract the name:
```bash
└─$ cat characters.json | jq -r ".data.attributes.name" | tee -a potential.txt
Bruce Wayne
Selina Kyle
Alfred Pennyworth
--- SNIP ---
```

One final tweak before launching `Kerbrute` is to convert the names into common AD username formats using the awesome tool [username-anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy)
```bash
└─$ ruby ~/tools/username-anarchy/username-anarchy --input-file potential.txt --select-format first,first.last,f.last,flast | tee -a users.txt
bruce
bruce.wayne
b.wayne
bwayne
selina
selina.kyle
s.kyle
skyle
alfred
alfred.pennyworth
--- SNIP ---
```
now running kerbrute:
```bash
┌──(pix3l㉿home)-[~/Desktop/machines/GothamCity]
└─$ kerbrute  userenum users.txt -d gotham.city --dc dc01.gotham.city

Now I can try attacks like `AS-REP roasting` to see if I can crack any user hashes. But all of em wasn't misconfigured.

I got stuck for hours and hours, trying every possible technique I knew to get an initial foothold but nothing worked. Eventually, I gave in and looked up a public writeup for the machine. Turns out when decompiling the Python bytecode, the first user was printed directly in the source code along with this message *which didn’t appear when I ran my copy of the binary* ):
> Flag:, If any error contact this person: lucius.fox1337 — this man is known for his careless style!

It even featured some Batman ASCII art, so it's likely that the original binary used during the CTF was different from the one currently available online.

So back to Gotham, I added this user and got a hit!:

```
Tried to crack it, but I couldn't. Back to hours of searching and I remembered that NetExec has this new module that [Kerberoast users via AS-REP Roasting](https://www.netexec.wiki/ldap-protocol/kerberoasting#kerberoasting-via-as-rep-roasting). Myabe that will work with `lucius`?..

got a hit on joker!, and it was crackable: `<3batman0893`

I reran NXC against the SMB shares and attempted to enumerate users and shares again. This time, I got:
- More valid users
- The **second flag** hidden in the *description* field of `harvey.dent`!

## 3rd flag

The next step was diving into `BloodHound` to look for any `ACL` misconfigurations. I noticed an interesting user with `GenericAll` on almost everything, so I marked it as a high-value target.

 Aside from that, there wasn’t much else of interest.

 I Contniued to enumerate using nxc and I got a hit on RDP:
 ```bash
