First I made a new user to get the PHP cookie to be able to enum the endpoits then I tried dirsearch and I got these endpoints:
```
‚îî‚îÄ$ dirsearch -u http://nocturnal.htb/ -H "Cookie: PHPSESSID=dkt7g9ap3jrfr19mjvbuhojd9m"

```
I then tried to upload multiple malicious files to be able to get a reverse shell but I couldn't.

Then I hovered over one of the files that I uploaded to see this URL:
```
http://nocturnal.htb/view.php?username=user&file=sample.pdf
```
Then I created another user and tried to visit the same URL to see if the website is vulnerable to IDOR and it worked! I was able to see the file `sample.pdf` while I was authenticated by another user.

So what if I enumerate both username and password for another valid file???

### privacy.odt
ffuf was the tool for this job

I created a wordlist with the user 'user' in it to filter the the unwanted pages
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/names1.png)

as we can see there are 2 users who are valid: `user (our crafted account)` and `admin`, so we can filter out all the responses with size of `2985`.
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/names2.png)
So I got these 3 users, I tried to fuzz files with each one of them only amanda worked:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/privacy.png)

I downloaded this file to see this:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/amanda.png)
So I tried to login on the website with these creds and it worked! and I got the admin panal.

## Foothold
Upon examining the source code of the website I stumbled across this function:
```
function cleanEntry($entry) {
    $blacklist_chars = [';', '&', '|', '$', ' ', '`', '{', '}', '&&'];

    foreach ($blacklist_chars as $char) {
        if (strpos($entry, $char) !== false) {
            return false; // Malicious input detected
        }
    }

    return htmlspecialchars($entry, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
}
```
So there is a potential command injection in the password parameter. I searched alot of techniques but the ones who worked for me was `%09` and `%0A` (tab and space)

> `üìù NOTE:` If you hover the cursor over an encoded string in burp it will decode it to be able to see the string clearly as it is shown.

Now we can upload a revshell
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/wget_revshell.png)
And execute it
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/foothold.png)

Inside the home directory of this user there is a file called `nocturnal_database.db`
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/tobias_hash.png)

And I got the user after ssh into the machine

## root
Getting root was easy. After messing around I checked the routing tables and I saw this:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/netstat.png)

I cd to `/var/www` to see what service it is hosted
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/ispconfig.png)
so there is a service called `ispconfig` is hosted only on from the localhost, so I tried to tunnel through it to be able to see it from my host machine using this command:
```
ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8080 tobias@10.10.11.64
```
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/isphome.png)

I tried a tool called `whatweb` to see what version of this service to be able to search for a public RCE or something but it was fruitless, so I viewed the page source and I found this:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/version.png)

I tried the username `admin` with password of the user `tobias` and I got in. We can verify the version from the help page:
![image](/assets/img/CTFs/Nocturnal/admin.png)

then I searched for an exploit for this version and there was a CVE-2023-46818. I searched online for a public exploit and tried it to get root
